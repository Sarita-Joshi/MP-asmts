All Second year Microprocessor assignments.

# Microprocessor Assignments

This repository contains a collection of assembly language programs developed for the second-year microprocessor course at Savitribai Phule Pune University. These programs are written for the BE Computer Engineering curriculum and cover a variety of basic tasks and concepts in microprocessor operation and assembly language programming.

## Description

The assignments are coded in assembly language, specifically designed to run on x86 processors. They include a range of programs from simple IO operations to more complex algorithmic implementations, all demonstrating the low-level programming skills required to manipulate hardware directly through software.
